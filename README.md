# Seevibes Pre-Interview Test

![Seevibes Logo](http://www.seevibes.com/assets/corpo/logo-small.png) 

Welcome to Seevibes! Thank you for thinking about our company.

Before we do an interview, we want to see a bit of code, and see how you work. This repository has the basic information you need to complete the task.

Please use any programming language, one your are comfortable with. We are Linux-centric, but you may submit a Windows program if that is easier for you.


## Test

Create a command-line program that will connect to the IMDB API and given a partial movie name on the command line, will return the full title and release year of the first movie. Some examples:

    $ ./program batman
    Title: Batman Begins
    Year: 2005

    $ ./program avengers
    Title: The Avengers
    Year: 2012


This is some exemples of my script :

	$ ./program.py batman
	Title: Batman
	Year: 1989

	$ ./program.py avengers
	Title: The Avengers
	Year: 2012

	$ ./program.py her
	Title: Her
	Year: 2013

	$ ./program.py superman
	Title: Superman
	Year: 1978


## Procedure

1. Fork this repository
2. Create the program
3. Submit a pull request, mentioning @francois and including a sample usage session with the titles above, and others of your own choosing
4. We will send you an email to confirm the interview details

The test should take about 30 minutes to complete.

Whether you've applied to Seevibes through an internship program, or just want to have fun, go ahead! Fork and tell us.
